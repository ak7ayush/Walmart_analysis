# **Recommendations**
---

	1. Promote product categories 1, 5, 8 since they are already a customer favorite and can fetch even higher revenues
	2. More male centric products can be added since males are the spending more and they make up about 75% of  total customers 
	3. Shipping should be improved to City category B since most of the customers live there
	4. We can also look at the historical data about the top performing products for males to get an idea about the product portfolio for future sales
	5. There is potential to increase spend by female customers since average spend is not too far behind male customers. Some incentives and female centric products can be introduced
    6. People of age group 50-55 are biggest spenders at Walmart. Discounts and products specific to this age group can be promoted
